Stable tag: 4.2.8

== Description ==

Agy is a modern and responsive solution for age verification with WooCommerce.
Simply setup the texts, modify the design and your ready.

This comes specially handy if your content or products are about alcohol, gambling or other adult content.

== How to use ==

After activation move to Settings->Agy and begin to configure your age verification settings.

Start with your general settings: add your age value, set the cookie lifetime, your exit URL and decide if it should apply to registered users or not.

Move to the text settings and customise all your texts. This is also the place to apply any translations with WPML or Polylang - simply use the language switcher in the admin bar.

To exlude a specific post, page or product from the age gate simply check the metabox inside the editor (works also with Gutenberg).

== Features ==

* Let users verify their age on page visit
* SEO friendly - This plugin automatically let bots and crawlers bypass the age gate (including google page speed bots)
* Exclude specific posts/pages/products from the Age Gate
* Use one or two column mode for additonal explanations
* Add your own logo and set a unique teaser area (two column mode)
* Show the age gate only for non-registered users
* Modify every text, color, background image and more
* redirect failed logins to a specified page
* mobil-friendly design

* Add an age checkbox to registration and checkout
* Save the information if the user is old enough in the account
* blacklist specific products, when the user does not match the age (works also with unregistered customers)

* Advanced technical support directly from the developer
